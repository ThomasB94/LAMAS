        Using this framework we performed experiments in which the three types of communication were compared. 
        The no communication setup was used to establish a base line that says how often a game will be won if there is no communication between players. 
        The absolute and relative communications were run with 1 to 3 communications for both types.

        With this setup, the simulation was run 1000 times with each setting and the number of games won along with the average number of removed worlds was recorded. 
        How many of the games are won gives a good insight into what the best communication strategy is when playing the game. 
        Additionally, the average number of removed worlds says something about how much information is given to the other player with an announcement.

        The results of these experiments can be found in the table below.

        The tables shows that for both absolute and relative communications there is a significant differnence with the no communication situation if 2 or 3 announcements are made.
